## divvup's backend

Everything here is written in go and is packaged up nicely into a docker container

This project is a learning experience for me, as such I tried to use all best practices
but sometimes when you are working by yourself things slip through the cracks. That's
why QA is there to save me. Right?

Some of my goals for this project include:
1.  Structure - go projects seem to have a very fluid strucutre I want to design and
    use a good one
2.  Documentation - I want my comments to mean something and I want them to be
    prevalent but not obtrusive
3.  More Documentation - I want to write some decent docs for how the api works so
    that different front ends can be developed
